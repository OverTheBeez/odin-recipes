      Prep: 5min Cook: 20min Servings: 4 Ingredients 1 lb ground beef 70-80%
      lean* 1 tbsp chili Powder ½ tsp salt ¾ tsp cumin ½ tsp dried Mexican
      oregano ¼ tsp granulated garlic ¼ tsp granulated onion ½ cup tomato sauce
      8 white corn tortillas ½ cup oil avocado or vegetable Instructions Cook
      Ground Beef: Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the ground beef.
      Break the beef up with a wooden spoon while cooking. Cook the ground beef
      fully, until browned and no longer pink. Drain: Drain any excess grease
      from the skillet. Then return to the stove and reduce the heat to low.
      Season: Add the 1/2 cup tomato sauce and taco seasoning. Stir together
      until the meat is coated in the sauce. Simmer: Allow to simmer for 5
      minutes. Fry Tortillas: Pour 1/2 cup oil in a medium size skillet, heat
      over medium high heat. Carefully dip a tortilla, if the oil sizzles and
      bubbles then it's hot enough. Gently lay the tortilla in the oil and fry
      each side for about 30 seconds, just enough to give some color and add
      some crispness. Shape Tortillas: Remove the tortilla to a paper towel to
      absorb oil, and carefully fold the tortilla over to create a taco shape. I
      do this with my tongs, or two forks, whatever I'm using to lay the
      tortillas in the oil and remove them. Toppings: Fill the tortillas with
      the ground beef taco meat and add desired toppings
